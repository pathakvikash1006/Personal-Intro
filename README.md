#Project Overview and Objectives:   
​The objective of this project is to create a basic interactive Python script that collects user information such as name, age, city, and hobby to display a personalized and friendly welcome message.

#​Setup and Installation Instructions:  
​Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
​Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
​Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project folder.
​Run the program using the command: python personal_intro.py.

#​Code Structure Explanation:  
​The script follows a simple logical flow:
​Input Section: Uses the input() function to pause execution and capture user data.
​Variables: The captured data is stored in descriptive variables like name, age, city, and hobby.
​Output Section: Uses the print() function combined with f-strings to merge the variables into a formatted, friendly sentence.

#​Technical Requirements Met:  
​[1] Use input(): Captured user details for name, age, city, and hobby.
​[2] Use variables: Stored all user inputs in specific variables for later use.
​[3] Use print(): Displayed a multi-line welcoming message.
​[4] GitHub Structure: Included README.md, personal_intro.py, and requirements.txt.

#​What I Learned:  
​Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:
​Data Collection: Understanding how to make a program interactive using the input() function.
​String Formatting: Learning how to use f-strings to create dynamic and readable output.
​Project Organization: Learning how to structure a project for GitHub with proper documentation and dependency files.
